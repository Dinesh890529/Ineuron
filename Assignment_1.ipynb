    "1. Python List:\n",
    "    \n",
    "An ordered sequence of items is called List. It is a very flexible data type in Python. \n",
    "There is no need for the value in the list to be of the same data type. \n",
    "The List is the data type that is highly used data type in Python.\n",
    "List datatype is the most exclusive datatype in Python for containing versatile data. \n",
    "It can easily hold different types of data in Python.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is effortless to declare a list. The list is enclosed with brackets and commas are used to separate the items. \n",
    "\n",
    "List Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "a = [5,9.9, 12, 13,25,55]\n",
    "\n",
    "One can also alter the value of an element in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Python Tuple:\n",
    "    \n",
    "A Tuple is a sequence of items that are in order, and it is not possible to modify the Tuples. \n",
    "The main difference list and tuples are that tuple is immutable, which means it cannot be altered. \n",
    "Tuples are generally faster than the list data type in Python because it cannot be changed or modified like list datatype.\n",
    "The primary use of Tuples is to write-protect data. \n",
    "Tuples can be represented by using parentheses (), and commas are used to separate the items. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "t = (6,7,8,9,10, 11.11)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a tuple, one can use the slicing operator to extract the item, but it will not allow changing the value. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Python Dictionary:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Dictionary is a type of python data type in which collections are unordered, and values are in pairs called key-value pairs.\n",
    "This type of data type is useful when there is a high volume of data. \n",
    "One of the best functions of Dictionaries data type is retrieving the data for which it is optimized. \n",
    "The value can only be retrieved if one knows the key to retrieve it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Braces {} (curly brackets) are used to define dictionaries data type in Python. \n",
    "A Pair in the dictionary data type is an item which is represented as key:value. \n",
    "The value and the key can be of any data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Dictionary Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "d1 = {'name': 'Dinesh'}\n",

    "We have many different types of expressions in Python:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Constant Expressions: These are the expressions that have constant values only.\n",
    "    eg: x = 15 + 1.3\n",

    "Here are some logical operators in Python:\n",
    "    \n",
    "P and Q --> It returns true if both P and Q are true otherwise returns false\n",
    "P or Q --> It returns true if at least one of P and Q is true\n",
